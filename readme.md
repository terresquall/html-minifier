A server-side source code minifier for Wordpress, HTML Minifier is designed to minimise and optimise HTML output.

== Description ==

HTML Minifier is a server-side source code minifier that is available both as a PHP class and as a Wordpress plugin. It is designed to optimise HTML output sent out to the client by removing whitespace, and by reorganising and / or merging <link>, <style> and <script> tags scattered across HTML pages that are built dynamically on server-side applications.

A variety of optimisation options and minification styles are available in the plugin, and they can be selected from or toggled depending on the user's needs. To see the full list of options or to download the PHP version, [click here](http://www.terresquall.com/web/html-minifier/).
